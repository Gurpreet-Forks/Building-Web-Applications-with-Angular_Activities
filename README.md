# Building Web Applications with Angular
This course teaches by doing. From the start, you'll learn the features of Angular2 by making useful apps and blocks of code. The projects in this book get you writing code straight away, while our expert authors explain at each step what it all means and what's going on under the hood. Set out as a series of tasks rather than topics, by building these sample applications for yourself while following our author's advice and insightful commentary, you'll soon have a portfolio of Angular2 work. You'll also learn Angular2 from the inside out, and be champing at the bit to start designing applications of your own.

## What you will learn
* Build fun projects to see how Angular2 really works in the wild
* Discover tips and tricks for working with real-world applications for real user needs
* Create your own Angular applications
